# ArtSC ðŸŽ¨

A Social Media App for Artists - Built at HackSC 2023 (Runner-Up)

# Overview

ArtSC is a social media app, available in both iOS app and web applications, designed to help artists in LA connect and collaborate based on their unique artistic styles. Built in under 36 hours at HackSC 2022, the project was selected as the first runner-up among 800+ participants. The app lets users upload artwork, view profiles, and get matched with other artists using a simple and intuitive interface.

# My Contributions
I am 100% responsible for the iOS application development of the project and 100% of the code in this repo was created by me. Besides, there were 3 other members in my team each of whom was responsible for artists matching machine learning models, a Backend server for mobile and web apps, and a front-end web application.
